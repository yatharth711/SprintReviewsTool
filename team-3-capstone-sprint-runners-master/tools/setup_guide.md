# Next.js installation guide

1. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed on your device. (You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal)
2. Make sure you're on the `framework_setup` branch and you've pulled
3. Download `app.zip` from the Google Drive
4. Replace the app folder in the repository with the one you just downloaded. There will be a decent amount of files with the same name, it shouldn't matter whether you replace them or not (I didn't replace them when setting it up on Tithi's laptop)
5. It should be set up now. To run the application, open a terminal and navigate to the app folder, then run `npm run dev`. (Or follow the instructions from the README.md in the app folder)
